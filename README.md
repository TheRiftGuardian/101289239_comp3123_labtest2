Hello sir, I requested to only display the current weather and you instructed me to add a text field and button to change the city if I were to do so.

So that is what I did.

By default the application displays the current weather of the city Toronto:

This information could be changed once a new City is typed and the button is clicked. 
Here is London for example:

And Moscow:

Additionally, error handling will prevent users from inputting cities that cannot be found.
The City 'aaaaaaaaa' isn't found when fetching for information and therefore an alert is displayed:

This will not change the current displayed information until a correct city that is availiable can be fetched.![144133934-d461da57-ebc6-4e4d-9a94-382c7a4b5d6c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77973089/144134444-2061e6dc-75ae-431d-b82f-492a7e811eeb.png)
